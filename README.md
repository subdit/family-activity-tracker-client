## FAMILY-ACTIVITY-TRACKER ##
The Family-Activity-Tracker repository is a full stack web application to allow the users to created their own activities for the family. To use this application the user must sign-up and sign-in by using email and create password.

## The Main Concept of: Family-Activity-Tracker ##
The main concept for Family-Activity-Tracker was inspiring by my family day to day activies routine. To keep track of our family activities that we have plan out. Most of the time my wife was doing the job and keep reminding me what is going on. So, as a developer, I want to build the application to help us keeping track of the events as a reminder. I think this application will be helpefull for a busy family like us. The calendar will allows the user to bookmark date, month and year to create the events. A third party API will allows the user to search the location where the events will be by using Google's map. The application itself has a lot more features to come and still under developing.

## User Stories ##
1. As a user, you will be able to create an account by signUp and signIn.
2. As a user, you will be able to create your own activity.
3. As a user, you will be able to update and delete the activities.
4. As a user, you will be able to bookmark the calendar for your event.
5. As a user, you will be able use Google's map for activity's location.

## Planning and Scheduling ##
My stategy was to set up the backend to suppost this API-Client first, by that I have to create Github repository to support the front-end-client application and setup Heroku to be my database supporter. Once the back-end has set and done, I moved to the user features. I build this frontend application in the based of MVP by created the auth and the CRUD. After that I used Bootstrap to import the style to customize my features in HTML file.
I started with download the links and setup the buid in template:

## List of Technology Used ##
The Technology that I use to build for this frontend application are JavaScript, HTML5, CSS and Bootstrap other than those I use Express build-in template. Bootstrap is a good source to play around with, which it allows me to add more features such as modals section, navbar and hover effects.

## The most challenging in this project ##
One of the most challenging in this project was how to implement the calendar into the index.html file in a proper way and how to present to the client side. I spent a lot of time to figure out how to mechanism this tool and I used Handlebar to solve this challenge. The second challenging was how to utilize a third party API, which I have learned, researched and tested out how to implementing a Google'map in the index.html file in such a short period of time.

## More features to build on to this application ##
1. I would like to add an email option for the users to share between their family
2. I would like to add noticfication into calendar by adding time scale and mobile alert.
